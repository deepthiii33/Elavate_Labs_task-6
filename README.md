## 📄 Project Files

- [`password_analysis.md`](./password_analysis.md) – Includes:
  - Password scores and feedback from tools
  - Best practices for creating strong passwords
  - Tips learned from evaluation
  - Common password attack types (e.g., brute force, dictionary)
  - Summary of how complexity impacts security

## ✅ Summary

- Simple and common passwords are weak and easily cracked.
- Substituting characters in dictionary words (e.g., `P@ssw0rd!`) is not secure.
- Random, long passwords with mixed character types are most effective.
