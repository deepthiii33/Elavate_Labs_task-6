## üîê Password 6: `veRR9v88gE@ww5G`

- **Tool Used:** [NordPass](https://nordpass.com/secure-password/)
- **Screenshot:** `

![](https://github.com/deepthiii33/Elavate_Labs_task-6/blob/main/screenshots/strong1_nordpass.png)
- **Feedback:**
  - Excellent length (15 characters)
  - Randomized use of multiple character types
  - Extremely high entropy
  - Estimated crack time: trillions of years
- **Verdict:** ‚úÖ Very Strong

---

## ‚úÖ Best Practices for Creating Strong Passwords

Based on this evaluation and tool recommendations:

- Use 12 characters or more
- Mix uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Avoid dictionary words and personal info
- Don‚Äôt reuse the same password across accounts
- Use a password manager to generate and store unique passwords
- Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA) for extra protection

---

##  üí° Lessons from Evaluation

- Replacing letters with symbols (P@ssw0rd!) isn‚Äôt enough
- Dictionary + number combos (Lemonade22) are easy to guess
- Random strings are far more secure
- Length and randomness are key for strength

## Common Password Attack Methods

#### 1. Brute Force Attack

- Involves trying every possible combination of characters until the correct password is found.
- Time-consuming but effective against short or simple passwords.
- Example: abc123, Lemonade22 (low complexity, short length)

#### 2. Dictionary Attack

- Uses precompiled lists of common passwords and words (from leaks, patterns, or language dictionaries).
- Efficient at breaking passwords that use real words or simple modifications.
- Example: Qwerty2025, P@ssw0rd! (contain common words or predictable substitutions)

#### 3. Credential Stuffing

- Attackers use usernames and passwords leaked from one website to try logging into others.
- Highly effective when users reuse passwords across services.
- Example: Any reused password from data breaches.

#### 4. Pattern Matching Attack

- Identifies keyboard patterns (like Qwerty, 1234), date formats, or known structures (like Word+Year).
- Exploits human tendencies to create memorable patterns.
- Example: Qwerty2025

## üîê How Password Complexity Affects Security

| Factor             | Effect on Security                                      |
|--------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Length             | Increases crack time exponentially                      |
| Randomness         | Avoids prediction by attackers                          |
| Character Variety  | Adds entropy, making brute-force harder                 |
| Avoiding Patterns  | Protects against dictionary/predictive attack methods   |

üß† A long, random, mixed-character password is **exponentially harder** to crack than a short or common one. Modern tools reward **entropy**, not just length.
